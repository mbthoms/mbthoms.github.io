      <p> The biggest thing about the internet is that you can post anything you want, what you want, anytime and anywhere you want. Now this said. I would love to have a blog for everything, but let's be real... Blogs always have a main focus... and that
        focus will have to be a new one for me.</p>

      <p>As you may know I'm a Web Design Student at the time of writing this and I should have started with blog a long time ago. For some reason I didn't think that I would have needed a blog or even thought that I have anything to share that would be
        worth reading / seeing.</p>

      <p>Like many people on sites like YouTube that make some of their living off of or all (depending on what happens to their channels) had to start from somewhere.</p>

      <p>I would love to start here. With this blog, I think that would be a great way to start. So I'm going to start by saying hello and tell a bit about myself.</p>

      <p>Hello, it's nice to meet you. I'm Matthew Thoms a Web Design Student from Southern Ontario, Canada. I love to talk about anything that is tech related. Gaming is a big part of my life also. Ever since I was a child I've been into Technology.</p>

      <p>The internet was what I really found the most interesting. I remember creating Piczo sites (Piczo was a website builder from the early 2000's). I loved making them, I found is fascinating that I could make something show up on the internet and have
        it stay there no matter what computer I was on.</p>

      <p>Now here I am, in college to become a web designer. To gain the knowledge to design and create for the web and the internet as a whole.<br><br> Have a great day,<br><br> Matthew Thoms</p>
