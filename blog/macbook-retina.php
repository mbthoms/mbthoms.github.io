        A year ago from today I got my first mac. MacBook Pros are very expensive, as we all know by now. The quality of the retina display is stunning. Apple has perfected the mobile display for a while now. Since the iPhone 4 Apple has coined the term “Retina
        Display” for their use on their displays.

      <h3>DVD Drive</h3>
      <p>
        There are some things that should still be in the MacBook, like a DVD Rom Drive. I still think that we should still have a DVD drive on a MacBook. I have had to use an external drive multiple times from drivers that come with new devices that require
        you to install before you can use the product. as I thought that I don’t use the DVD drive that much I do find myself missing it at the most inconvenient times.

      <h3>Graphics and Temperature</h3>
      <p>
        The graphics card in the system is integrated for the baseline model which is the one I have.it backs the Intel Iris Pro graphics which is not bad for an integrated graphics card but then again they should really think about the heat that comes out of
        the system when you were doing anything graphics related that requires a lot of power from the graphics card.usually if you need a lot of graphics card or you need a lot of CPU power which means that the integrated graphics is on the CPU chip
        itself and that heats up very fast. I have gotten the system up to over 100°C. At that point it starts to burn you. The bottom is burning and the top is also burning the only cool spot on the whole system when it’s at that temperature is the top
        of the screen which is obvious.
      </p>
      <h3>Weight and Size</h3>
      <p>
        The weight and size are incredible. You would think that the computer would be heavier than it is because of the power that it has under the hood. The Weight is around: 2.04 kg (4.49 pounds) depending on what configuration and manufacturing process. That’s
        still incredibly light for a full workhorse of a computer. As for the size of the computer, I went for the 15″ model because I need the screen real estate for the work I do (Web Design and Development).

      <h3>Keyboard and Trackpad</h3>

        Apple makes one of the best feeling keyboards for a laptop that I think. I love mechanical keyboards for laptop computers, the MacBook Pro has one of the best. Coming from using PC’s all my life converting to the Mac style keyboard was a Little hard at
        first but as for anything you got used to it. Getting my first MacBook wasn’t really my first Macintosh experience. I use Macintosh computers at school and whenever somebody needed help with their MacBook or desktop Mac, mostly at school though.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyways back to what I was saying about the keyboard. Going from a PC keyboard to an Apple keyboard is a little different if you haven’t used one before. I find going back to a PC keyboard hard to do but I can if I need to. Just the command and control
        keys are in different places.

        Now onto the trackpad. Again for Apple trackpads, they are the best in the computer Industry. I don’t know what it is, but they know how to make a trackpad. I think it mostly because the trackpad is lag free. Windows trackpads have lag to them most of
        the time. I really think that because apple makes they own hardware and software that the combination makes for the best experience possible. Many trackpads are plastic but Apple makes their Trackpad out of glass so you get the best tracking experience.
        Apple makes the track pads oversized for a reason. Making the track pads oversized helps with the tracking experience as your screen is bigger then the screen and to make it 1:1 ratio they need to make it a little bigger than normal size trackpads.
      </p>
      <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
      <p>
        As this may seem like an ad for Apple, it’s not I have tried many laptops and many desktops Mac and PC alike if you were looking to buy a computer Mac and PC are both computers, they both run on the same processors, use the same kind of RAM and use the
        same kind of hard drives. As far as who is better it’s really up to the user and what experience they want to experience during their use of a computer.
