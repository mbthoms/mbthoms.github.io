      <h2>What is Atom Editor?</h2>
      <p><a href="http://atom.io/">Atom Editor</a> is a cross-platform code editor that is made by GitHub.</p>
      <h3>Cross-platform you say?</h3>
      <p>Yes, Atom is an application that can run on computer platforms/Operating System like Windows, Mac OS X and Linux distributions. I use Atom everyday to code, write documents and even to jot down notes for class or like a to do list. There are a lot
        of things that are great about Atom like the package manager, autocompletion, the file system browser and multiple panes.</p>
      <h3>Package Manager</h3>

  <div class="row container text-center">
    <img class="blog-img" src="../images/blog/atom-editor/atom-screenshot-package-manager.png" alt="" class="blog-img" />
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
    <p>You can search for packages and install them into Atom easily with the built-in package manager. You can also create your own packages for <a href="http://atom.io">Atom</a>.<br> I love to have my code editor setup with all the packages that help me
      code with more functionality and be more efficiently.</p>
    <h3>Autocompletion</h3>
    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 text-center">
      <img src="../images/blog/atom-editor/autocompletion-screenshot.png" alt="" class="blog-img" />
    </div>
    <p>Atom has code hinting to help you write code faster. I find it helpful when you are coding and you may forget what the syntax is for, lets say an if statement. Atom will help you autocomplete the if statement with the right syntax. You also could
      get new packages that help with autocompletion for maybe things like colours or fonts.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12">
    <h3>File system browser</h3>
    <p>You can easily open a single file or a whole project depending on what you are going to do with the editor at the time of using it. I love to use the editor to open a whole project so I can go back and forth to the pages that I need to code e.g. CSS
      and HTML or JavaScript.</p>
    <h3>Multiple Panes</h3>

    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-12 text-center">
      <img src="../images/blog/atom-editor/pane-screenshot.png" alt="" class="blog-img" />
    </div>
    <p>Atom lets you have multiple panes in one window so you can edit code across files like having HTML and CSS open to figure out what classes you put on your tags to style them in the CSS. It's very useful as I use it daily. I don't think I could live
      without it.</p>
    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>As I use the code editor daily I find more and more things that I love about it. Like I said before I use it on Mac and PC for doing web design work across computers, depending on the work.</p>
